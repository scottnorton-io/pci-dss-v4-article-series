PCI DSS v4.0 enhances authentication requirements, mandates multi-factor authentication (MFA) across broader use cases, strengthens password requirements, and tightens session management rules."

Mature organizations integrate centralized identity and access management (IAM) platforms to manage authentication policies consistently."
