# Requirement 5 - Protect All Systems and Networks from Malicious Software
## Introduction

Requirement 5 mandates the use of anti-malware solutions to protect all systems and networks commonly affected by malicious software. PCI DSS v4.0 expands malware protection beyond traditional servers and endpoints to modern architectures, such as containers and cloud instances.

## Requirement 5 at a Glance

- Deploy anti-malware solutions where malware threats exist.
- Keep detection mechanisms and signatures up to date.
- Monitor and respond to malware alerts.
- Document systems evaluated, including those exempt from malware controls.

## What This Means in Practice

Organizations must deploy anti-malware tools on all applicable systems, continuously update detection engines, monitor for malware activity, and respond appropriately. Systems deemed exempt must have documented risk justifications. Mature programs automate malware detection and integrate with SIEMs for incident response.

## Gotchas

- Overlooking cloud servers, containers, or IoT devices.
- Anti-malware tools installed but signatures not updated.
- Malware alerts generated but not monitored or actioned.
- Systems exempted without formal risk assessment and documentation.

## Trusted Advisor (TA) Tip

Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions where feasible. Use automated alerting and centralized management consoles to ensure malware detections trigger timely investigations and responses.

## Use Case Lenses

**Executive Lens**

Demonstrates proactive security practices and strengthens organizational resilience against ransomware and malware outbreaks.

**Security & Infra Teams Lens**

Focuses on ensuring updated malware signatures, monitoring detection events, and automating malware response actions.

**QSA/Consultant Lens**

Look for evidence of updated anti-malware software, active monitoring, formal exemption processes, and automated detection methods where applicable.

**Small Business Lens**

Use cloud-managed anti-malware solutions and confirm that alerting and updates happen automatically across all systems.

## Call to Action (CTA)

Review all systems today: confirm anti-malware protections are deployed where needed, updates are automated, and monitoring of malware activity is active and effective.
