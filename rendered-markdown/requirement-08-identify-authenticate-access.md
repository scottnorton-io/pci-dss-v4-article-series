# Requirement 8 - Identify and Authenticate Access to System Components
## Introduction

Requirement 8 focuses on ensuring that every user accessing system components is properly identified and authenticated. PCI DSS v4.0 enhances authentication requirements, mandates multi-factor authentication (MFA) across broader use cases, strengthens password requirements, and tightens session management rules.

## Requirement 8 at a Glance

- Assign each user a unique ID.
- Require MFA for all non-console admin access and remote access.
- Enforce minimum password length of 12 characters (by March 31, 2025).
- Control session inactivity timeouts, lockouts, and terminations.
- Protect privileged access accounts with enhanced authentication mechanisms.

## What This Means in Practice

Organizations must ensure all users have unique credentials, enforce strong password/passphrase policies, deploy MFA for all admin and remote access points, and monitor session activity. Mature organizations integrate centralized identity and access management (IAM) platforms to manage authentication policies consistently.

## Gotchas

- Incomplete MFA coverage for internal administrative access.
- Password policies allowing weak, short, or unchanging passwords.
- Inactive user accounts remaining enabled beyond thresholds.
- Inconsistent session timeout enforcement across applications and platforms.

## Trusted Advisor (TA) Tip

Use federated identity services (like SSO + MFA) tied to a single authoritative source to manage all access uniformly. Automate dormant account detection and disablement to reduce insider threat risks.

## Use Case Lenses

**Executive Lens**

Demonstrates commitment to securing access, protecting customer data, and mitigating credential theft risks.

**Security & Infra Teams Lens**

Focuses on configuring strong authentication methods, enforcing session controls, and monitoring access events.

**QSA/Consultant Lens**

Look for documented authentication policies, evidence of unique IDs, MFA deployment coverage, password settings, and session control enforcement.

**Small Business Lens**

Use cloud-based IAM solutions with built-in MFA and password policies to simplify compliance.
