NEVER USE CANVAS.

Create a complete, professional PCI DSS v4.x (or other compliance framework) article series following these rules:

1. Write one structured JSON article per Requirement.
2. Combine Appendices where needed into separate structured JSON articles.
3. Generate:
    - Article Template
    - Requirements Articles
    - Appendix Articles
    - Master Summary Document (TOC + Quick Summaries)
    - Compliance Lifecycle Best Practices Guide
    - Changelog.txt (track all versions)
    - GitHub README.md (structured for professional repositories)
    - .gitignore (optimized for macOS Silicon and Dev environments)
    - Release Notes Markdown (.md) (for GitHub Releases)
    - Swipe File Document (pre-built examples, quick references, tips for implementers)
4. Prepare a Cumulative Bundle:
    - All articles
    - Template
    - Supporting assets
    - README
    - GitHub metadata (.gitignore, Release Notes)
    - Changelog.txt
    - Swipe File
5. Final Package Instructions:
    - Structure folders ready for GitHub publication.
    - Version the project using Semantic Versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (start with 1.0.0 and increment as work proceeds).
6. ZIP and offer download at each major milestone.

Additional Instructions:
- No repeated questions about adding extras. All listed extras must be built automatically.
- No skipping governance assets or polish layers. Assume all professional touches are required.
- Always maintain tone: Human-readable, practical, polished, professional.
- Always include a final sign-off note, kitchen sink reference optional but appreciated.

Deliver:
- Cumulative download (.zip)
- Final Sign-off
- If applicable, optional social-ready announcement text.

You are authorized to move quickly, assume full project authority to decide on structure and polish without reconfirmation unless explicitly asked otherwise.
